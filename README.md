# Emergency_Finder

  * The “Emergency Finder“ App is a interface for the citizens to locate emergency service providing agencies
 (police station, hospital, fire station) on satellite Image within the periphery of current location so that
  they can easily “reach” the agency in case of emergency.

  * The App displays the current location of the citizen on the Google Map along with details such as name of 
  places, roads and major landmarks.
  
  * The App dynamically fetches details of all the agencies near the location of the citizen.
  
  * The App further provides the facility to “Tap” any of this service providing agencies and know the
  route and road distance to reach there and contact numbers.
  
  * The App provides “Tap on Call” facility through which citizen can make an emergency call (911).
